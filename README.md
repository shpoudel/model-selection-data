# Data generation for training ML-based topology ranking

This repository contains the Python code to generate data using OpenDSS powerflow solution. Different radial topologies are generated using switching combinations and power flow is sovled for each topology using a load profile. The sensor measurements for each topology is extracted to "outputs" folder.
